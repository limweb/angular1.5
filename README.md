# Angular 1.5 Webpack & ES6

This is boilerplate code for an Angular 1.5x app written in ES6 and uses Webpack as its module bundler and Babel for transpiling.

## Dependencies

Latest version of Node

## Usage

- run npm i => install all dependencies from package.json
- npm start => will run webpack dev server, no need for browsersync or xampp/mamp/wamp


**version: 1.0.0**

Structure setup for using ES6 and Component Routing, not complete yet but good enough to give you an idea
